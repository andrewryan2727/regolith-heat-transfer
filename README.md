Mesh generation files for netgen have been uploaded as .geo files. Netgen was downloaded with macports. Actual mesh files are available on request but are too large to host here. 
The particle size ranges for each filename are as follows (in cm):
7b: 0.318-1.27
7c: 0.318-1.588
7d: 0.318-1.905
7d2: 0.635-1.905
monoish: 1.0-3.0

Power law exponents (e.g. -2.5, -3.0, -3.5) are given in the filename.
